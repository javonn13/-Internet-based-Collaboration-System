Me and my group was asked to use the recursive decomposition technique described by the Attribute Driven Design (ADD) methodology. Through multiple iterations, an architecture addressing the above problem statement will be formed. Using the information generated as part of the previous Project Checkpoints (including Engineering Objectives, Quality Attributes and Scenarios, Tactics, Use Cases, Functional Requirements, among other details), a design fulfilling the Architectural Drivers which should be generated. Each section following will present a cycle of the recursive decomposition targeting a specific Architectural Driver, beginning with the creation of a monolithic system design and continuing from there.
